# Palindrome

Program uses stacks to read a line of text and tells if the line is a palindrome. Upper-case and lower-case letters are treated as the same character. Stack only takes non-blank characters into consideration.

LinkedStackDS has a private inner class called StackNode.

Test data is hardcoded into the demo program to test for:

1) Too bad--I hid a boot
2) Some men interpret eight memos
3) "Go Hang a Salami! I'm a Lasagna Hog"
4) A man, a plan, a canal-Panama
5) Gateman sees my name, garageman sees name tag
